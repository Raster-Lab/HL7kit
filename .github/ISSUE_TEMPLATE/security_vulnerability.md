## ⚠️ STOP - READ THIS FIRST ⚠️

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities as public GitHub issues.

For security issues:

1. **Email**: security@hl7kit.org with details
2. **Include**: Description, impact, reproduction steps
3. **Wait**: For response before public disclosure
4. **Follow**: Responsible disclosure guidelines

## Why Private Reporting?

Public disclosure of security vulnerabilities can:
- Put users at risk
- Enable exploitation before patches are available
- Violate responsible disclosure practices

## What Qualifies as a Security Issue?

- Authentication/authorization bypasses
- Data exposure or PHI leakage
- Injection vulnerabilities (code, SQL, XML)
- Cryptographic weaknesses
- Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities
- Memory safety issues (buffer overflows, use-after-free)
- Insecure defaults that could lead to compromise

## What is NOT a Security Issue?

- Missing features (use Feature Request)
- Configuration issues (use Bug Report)
- Standards compliance questions (use GitHub Discussions)
- Performance problems (use Bug Report)

## Security Response Process

We aim to:
1. Acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. Provide initial assessment within 5 business days
3. Keep you informed throughout investigation
4. Credit reporters (unless anonymity requested)
5. Coordinate disclosure timing
